# Iris Dataset Analysis Using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.

## Dataset

We will use the Iris dataset for this assignment. The dataset contains 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

## Questions Explored

1. **Line Plot:** Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers. Use different colors to represent each species.
2. **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the petal length and petal width. Use different colors to represent each species.
3. **Histogram:** Plot a histogram showing the distribution of the petal widths. Use different colors to represent each species and display a legend.
4. **Bar Plot:** Create a bar plot showing the average sepal width for each species.
5. **Pie Chart:** Assume that the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each species in the population.
6. **Box Plot:** Create a box plot showing the distribution of sepal length for each species.
7. **Subplots:** Combine the scatter plot and the histogram into one figure by using subplots.
